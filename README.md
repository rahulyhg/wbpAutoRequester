# wbpAutoRequester v1.0
#### Add a task to a controlable webpanel that use Basic Realm Authentication with cURL in PHP.

# Deployment:
#### Simply modify the script for your purpose and upload it to your webserver and run the API.

# PoC:
#### Let's imagine that John wont let you access his server with files that contain code for a controlable webpanel that performs actions but you somehow still need to be able to add a task without having to login via Basic Realm Authentication and manually add the task or task(s) then wbpAutoRequester does the job with cURL.
